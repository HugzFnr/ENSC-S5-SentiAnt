# SentiAnt

A game made to introduce to AI elements where you code the behavior of an entire ant hill. Bring the cookie to your queen before the others !

The first step is to code your ant hill, which require a minimum of 2 python files : one for your Queen, and another for your first class of ant. When you get to the point where your Queen actually spawns ants, you can watch them do stuff on a 2D grid and click to pass the turns or let them go quickly and automatically.

The game and the functions you can use in your code are explained in details in the wiki, but once again, in french (sorry).
